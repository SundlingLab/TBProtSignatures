# TBProtSignatures

Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly infectious disease that affects millions of people globally. TB proteomics signature discovery has been a rapidly growing area of research that aims to identify protein biomarkers for the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of TB. In this review, we have highlighted recent advances in this field and how it is moving from the study of single proteins to high-throughput profiling and from proteomics to multi-omics. This review covers the different sample types and experimental technologies used in TB proteomics signature discovery. We also describe signature discovery in the context of targeted and non-targeted approaches. We then briefly discuss the association between the identified proteins and biological pathways. Furthermore, this review presents an analysis of the frequency of proteins in different published signatures, highlighting potential biomarker candidates. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges in TB proteomics signature discovery, such as the need for integration of multi-omics data and the importance of control cohorts and signature validation.
