# TBProtSignatures

Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly infectious disease that affects millions of people globally. TB proteomics signature discovery has been a rapidly growing area of research that aims to identify protein biomarkers for the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of TB. Moving from the study of single proteins to high-throughput profiling and from proteomics to multi-omics has been highlighted in this review as recent advances in TB biomarker discovery. This review covers the different sample types and different experimental technologies used in TB proteomics signature discovery. We also discusses the association between proteins and KEGG signaling pathways, providing insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of TB infection and progression. Furthermore, this review presents an analysis of the frequency of proteins in different published signatures, highlighting potential biomarker candidates. Finally, we discusses the limitations and challenges in TB proteomics signature discovery, such as the need for the integration of multi-omics data.
